# Space Invaders
This game is a javascript clone of the classic 1970's arcade game, Space Invaders. It is written in vanilla JS to keep it lightweight. Phaser was considered, but ultimately I decided I wanted to do this one without the use of any major libraries.

So far, no major development work has been done, and this is mostly being used as storage for remote work until more serious development can be started. I have added in all the object models and most of the sounds, and done some of the programming work, but it is still in the early stages.
