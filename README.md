# Space Invaders
This game is a javascript clone of the classic 1970's arcade game, Space Invaders. It is written in vanilla JS to keep it lightweight. Phaser was considered, but ultimately I decided I wanted to do this one without the use of any major libraries.

So far, I have added in all the object models except for the barriers and am working on developing the game mechanics. Most of the game is finished, and when the mechanics feel solid, I will work on cleaning up the code some. I also plan to get to work on developing new character models that are not owned by Square Enix to avoid any potential copyright issues later down the road. If that happens before this is fully developed, I will likely borrow from a homebrew that does not have a copyright until my own models can be created.
